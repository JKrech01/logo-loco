## Description:
Build a logo generator that takes user input and generates an SVG logo and saves it as logo.svg file.  Create a video going through the functionality.

## Lessons Learned
Something to simple gave me quite a challenge.  In the end, I ended up reaching out to a tutor that helped me figure out I had the wrong version of inquirer and to the instructor so I can move past the questions.  I also had a hard time seeing the finished logo and with the help of the Xpert Learning Assistant was able to finish the project.
